# World Of [Development]
World Of is a platform for the creation of CYOA-style digital fiction. This repo maintains the codebase for this project.

## Getting Started
Clone this repo locally. Refer to the Git Workflows page on the Wiki for more information on working with Git.

After you've done so, you will need to do 2 things locally that are not included in the git version of the codebase.

1. Create api/config.php and define PHP constants for DB_HOST, DB_USER, DB_PASS, and DB that store the respective mysql connection details.

2. Create your local database based on the appropriate details you've specified.
